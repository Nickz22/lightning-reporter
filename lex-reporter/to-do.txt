/**
 * rte should expand on row click, but avatar should still stay as an indication that there has been convo on that row (not really v1)
 * need to guide people toward a table config creation flow 
 ** if they haven't created one yet...
 ** that way I can assume those will exist and 
 ** don't have to deal with performance implications of 
 ** looping thru all child types
 * Send salesforce notification to mentioned users on note save
 * find a way to make new comments show up in real time
 * we'll want to save table shapes like reports
 ** so if people want to pin a table or something they can...
 ** they're not going to want to reconfigure the same table on every render
 * threaded replies
 * dont forget to change the user search component to actually search users
 *
 * 
 * almost there...
 * what else can be added tho? Might be good to reflect on the persona for whom we're creating this, what do they want to do?

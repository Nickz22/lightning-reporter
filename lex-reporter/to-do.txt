/**
 * need to guide people toward a table config creation flow 
 ** or default to a shape and figure out best way of enabling custom table shapes
 * we'll want to save table shapes like reports
 ** so if people want to pin a table or something they can...
 ** they're not going to want to reconfigure the same table on every render
 * threaded replies (v2)
 * dont forget to change the user search component to actually search users
 * Note metadata upsert is erroring via unique id, should be updating records with same unique id
 * table ordering
 * table re-render is causing pencil icons to show up again (bubble event to top-level to stop poller while editing)
 * remove orange ring from avatar when clicked
 * almost there...
 * what else can be added tho? Might be good to reflect on the persona for whom we're creating this, what do they want to do?

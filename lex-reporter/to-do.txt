/**
 * might be good to include view-count as a utility feature (better to include thread replies)
 * rte should expand on row click, but avatar should still stay as an indication that there has been convo on that row (not really v1)
 * need to guide people toward a table config creation flow 
 ** if they haven't created one yet...
 ** that way I can assume those will exist and 
 ** don't have to deal with performance implications of 
 ** looping thru all child types
 * Send salesforce notification to mentioned users on note save
 * urls are still going to google.com
 * find a way to make new comments show up in real time
 * we'll want to save table shapes like reports
 ** so if people want to pin a table or something they can...
 ** they're not going to want to reconfigure the same table on every render
 * threaded replies

/**
 * Definitely use list layouts as base level options
 * Might be worth creating Lex Table Configs to hold customizations on top of layouts
 * Note metadata upsert is erroring via unique id, should be updating records with same unique id
 *
 * table re-render is causing pencil icons to show up again (bubble event to top-level to stop poller while editing)
 * align headers to cells
 * enable pinning of views (via table config records)
 * seems to be something intermittently wrong with user searching
 * almost there...
 *
 * what else can be added tho? Might be good to reflect on the persona for whom we're creating this, what do they want to do?
 * *** hotkey to expand all rows 
 *
 *
 ***** table ordering (v2)
 ***** threaded replies (v2)
